## Files Modified

- `app.py`: 
  - Improved environment variable loading
  - Added configuration validation
  - Enhanced health check endpoint
  - Improved error handling

- `bot.py`:
  - Simplified setup_bot function
  - Made token validation more robust
  - Improved error handling
  - Removed redundant _start_polling function
  
## New Files Added

- `README.md`: Documentation of the module
- `test_signal.py`: Test script for webhook
- `CHANGES.md`: Documentation of improvements

## Testing

The changes have been implemented in a way that maintains backward compatibility with the existing system while improving reliability. The module can be tested by:

1. Setting up proper environment variables in `.env`
2. Running the connector with `python run.py`
3. Testing the webhook with `python test_signal.py`
4. Checking health status at `/health` endpoint

## Next Steps

1. Complete the signal processing improvements to further simplify the code
2. Add more test scripts for comprehensive testing
3. Consider adding a configuration wizard for easier setup
